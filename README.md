## My Scala Projects

### Project 2

<!-- Acc / CHMC -->

<!-- Designed new data model and technical architecture for a federal government client
Integrated financial data from SAS, DB2, Oracle, MS SQL and legacy to Cloudera data lake (HDFS) with Python PySpark scripts.
Built profiling and data quality jobs with Informatica Developer and Informatica Analyst; monitored at Informatica Administrator.
Implemented the initial load and delta loads for new Power BI model and Slice & Dice Power BI reports with role-based security control.
Created data dictionary, business glossary and business rules for 800+ data attributes in Collibra. -->

Architected a scalable data platform for a federal government client by designing a new data model and robust technical architecture.

- Developed distributed data integration pipelines using Scala and PySpark to ingest and transform financial data from SAS, DB2, Oracle, MS SQL, and legacy systems into the Cloudera data lake (HDFS).

- Enhanced data profiling and quality processes using Informatica Developer and Analyst, with operational monitoring through Informatica Administrator.

- Designed and executed initial and incremental (delta) data loads to support a new Power BI semantic model, delivering dynamic Slice & Dice reports with row-level security.

- Authored a comprehensive data dictionary, business glossary, and business rules for over 800 attributes, published and maintained in Collibra for enterprise-wide data governance.

### Project 1

<!-- Created an Scala POC for an US client
Create the back end APIs with the play framework, sbt and ScalaTest.
Built the UI with Scala.js.
Built a trading data analysis app and generated the reports for a financial client
Used Scala to analyze all the trading data files in the folder, then generated the reports for top 20 tickers and counter parties. -->

Developed a Scala proof of concept (PoC) for a U.S. client, showcasing a full-stack application using the Play Framework, sbt, and ScalaTest for back-end API development.

- Implemented the front end with Scala.js, enabling a seamless Scala-to-JavaScript development experience in a unified codebase.

- Built a trading data analytics application for a financial services client, using Scala to parse and analyze large volumes of trading data files.

- Automated generation of analytical reports highlighting the top 20 tickers and counterparties, supporting decision-making with insightful metrics and trends.
